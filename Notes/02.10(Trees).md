## 2-3-4 Tree
  - A balanced tree can have O(n) = log(N)
  - To maintain O(n) = log(N), the tree must be completely balanced
    - contains   --> O(log N)
    - add        --> O(N) (worst case)
    - remote     --> O(N) (worst case)
  - Binary tree has O(N) pretty much in all cases

*** Assignment3 show 2-3-4 tree of 20 numbers/keys ***

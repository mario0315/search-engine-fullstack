This assignment asks you to create a similarity-based recommendation system using the online Yelp sample dataset. Get it, and (recommended) also the csv converter from the the Yelp github utilities. The program stores records from any of the data sets and choice of key. For this assignment, you can limit the data store size to 10000 records (ignoring the rest). You can choose to read data either as JSON or csv. Establish a similarity metric, that must include information based on custom frequency tables (as will be discussed in class), possibly weighted by or in conjunction with other attributes. Create a GUI that allows a user to indicate one entity, and displays one or more similar ones. The presentation details are up to you. Use Swing, JavaFX, or Android components for the GUI. For Swing, read through the relevant parts of the Swing tutorial first.

Test your program thoroughly before submitting, and arrange a demo within 48 hours of submitting. (Demoing before submitting is strongly encouraged.)
